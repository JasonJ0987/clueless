As a team, I wear whatevr has decided on developing a website to help decide an outfit based on the weather and event the user plans on attending. As a user, the client will be able to upload images of their clothing items, tracking their closet with easy access. The outfits can be uploaded and stored in a weekly planner.
i created a mock home page for our website.
 functions
- favoriting certain clothing items
- potential social aspects with friending and viewing other accounts? (undecided)
- a rotating visual to plan outfits.
