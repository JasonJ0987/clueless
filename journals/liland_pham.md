## May 8th, 2023
1. With the help of the team, we came up with a project idea of creating a clothing, planning app in order to know what to wear to an event based on the weather of the week. The outfits will have to fall in line with the weather and the type of event the end-user is attending.
2. Today, I am planning ideas for Project Gamma and seeing what third party API the team should use to implement in the project.
3. As of today, I currently have no blockers per say but I would like to get better at reading the documentations for the third party APIs and seeing if I can implement the APIs.

Project Details For Now:
Team Name: Corporate Espionage
Title: I Wear Whatevr
Slogan: Clueless for now

## May 9th, 2023
1. Finished the wire-framing design with the team. Added comments to Excalidraw and prioritized the pages that are more important for the project. The pages that are considered as "stretch goals", we placed them to the side, for now.
2. Today, I am planning to talk to my team whether it's important for us to have multiple microservices or not. As of now, it seems like we can just work out of one monolith folder since none of the app seems to be polling from one another. Also, we will attempt to have a head start with the API design.
3. Not quite understanding on how API design works so far but maybe I'll have a better understanding after Thursday's lecture.

## May 10th, 2023
1. Went over the wire-framing design with the team before presenting it to Violet. Violet made some suggestions and we cleaned up the design a little bit before importing it into VS Code.
2. Finishing wire-framing design and completing the API design. Try to get a little bit more insight/clarification on how to write an API endpoint for the project.
3. No blockers for today.

## May 11th, 2023
1. Reviewed the API design endpoints and discussed how to arrange the format for the issues that are being created on GitLab. Went through the examples of the issues that were released on Learn. Got started on the simpler functions such as login, logout, sign up, and buttons to redirect to a new page.
2. Get started on writing issues for the project's functions and hopefully get through most of the creation of the issues by today. If not, we have time to finish creating them on Friday.
3. No blockers for today.

## May 12th, 2023
1. Completed the rest of our issues.
2. Today, the team and I will create the rest of our issues and start talking about whether we want to implement SQL or MongoDB to the project.
3. No blockers for today.
