1. What did you do?
2. What are you planning to do today?
3. Do you have any blockers/challenges to your progress?

1. With the help of the team, we came up with a project idea of creating a clothing, planning app in order to know what to wear to an event based on the weather of the week. The outfits will have to fall in line with the weather and the type of event the end-user is attending.
2. Today, I am planning ideas for Project Gamma and seeing what third party API the team should use to implement in the project.
3. As of today, I currently have no blockers per say but I would like to get better at reading the documentations for the third party APIs and seeing if I can implement the APIs.

Project Details For Now:
Team Name: Corporate Espionage
Title: I Wear Whatever
Slogan: Clueless for now

1. Finished the wire-framing design with the team. Added comments to Excalidraw and prioritized the pages that are more important for the project. The pages that are considered as "stretch goals", we placed them to the side, for now.
2. Today, I am planning to talk to my team whether it's important for us to have multiple microservices or not. As of now, it seems like we can just work out of one monolith folder since none of the app seems to be polling from one another. Also, we will attempt to have a head start with the API design.
3. Not quite understanding on how API design works so far but maybe I'll have a better understanding after Thursday's lecture.
