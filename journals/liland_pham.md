1. What did you do?
2. What are you planning to do today?
3. Do you have any blockers/challenges to your progress?


May 8th, 2023
1. With the help of the team, we came up with a project idea of creating a clothing, planning app in order to know what to wear to an event based on the weather of the week. The outfits will have to fall in line with the weather and the type of event the end-user is attending.
2. Today, I am planning ideas for Project Gamma and seeing what third party API the team should use to implement in the project.
3. As of today, I currently have no blockers per say but I would like to get better at reading the documentations for the third party APIs and seeing if I can implement the APIs.

Project Details For Now:
Title: I Wear Whatever
Slogan: Clueless for now
