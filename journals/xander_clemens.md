1. What did you do?
2. What are you planning to do today?
3. Do you have any blockers/challenges to your progress?

## 5/8/2023
Developed ideas for our project and identified who our users are, the high-level functionality of our application, and the APIs needed to bring our project to life. Next, we constructed a logo and first draft wireframe to represent better what we will need to do for our project.

## 5/9/2023
1. Unavailable to work on the project today.
2. Familiarize myself more with fastAPI, learn more about what needs to go into our API designs, and understand how we will meet our minimal value product.
3. My challenges for today and this week would be related to APIs and with more practice time for understanding how this will work and relate to our project.

## 5/10/2023
1. We finalized our wireframes, met with our project consultant to understand the importance of our Most Viable Product, created our first version of our out API endpoints, and uploaded everything into our project code.
2. Organize our wireframe images and assist in the creation of our FastAPI endpoints to use in our design.
3. Mainting a realist perspective on our work of our wireframe, following our key bullet points addressed to our Minimal Viable Product list, and knowing that the following weeks of learning new technologies and integrating our API needs to be heavily focused on still achieving our Minimal Viable Product list.

## 5/11/2023
 1. Contributed to the template and stories for our issues for the functions used in our project.
2. Defining the story, feature, and descriptions of our features: login, signup, closet page, style button, weekly outfit planner, and a logout button.
3. We discussed establishing baselines for what clothes will be displayed to the user depending on the weather temperature and the weaker description tag from Open Weather API. Currently, this is still being determined as to the accurate baselines we want to use.

## 5/12/2023
1. Contributed to the template and stories for our issues for the functions used in our project. We finalized our issue creation on GitLab. Finishing with thirteen total issues.
2. Completing our issue stories for the various functions we must create for our application to meet our minimum viable requirements.
3. No challenges or blockers for today's work. We are still uncertain about the type of database we will use. However, come Monday, after learning more about MongoDB, we will better understand the direction we pursue a database in our project.

## 5/15/2023
1. Defined what database we were going to use for our application and decided on using MongoDB
2. Help provide feedback and discuss with the team in deciding what database we will implement for our project.
3. No blockers or challenges as we are nearing the end of our planning and design phase and will soon be moving into the development phase, where we begin to code. At this point, more challenges and blockers will exist during this project.
