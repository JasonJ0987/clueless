## 5/8/2023
Developed ideas for our project and identified who our users are, the high-level functionality of our application, and the APIs needed to bring our project to life. Next, we constructed a logo and first draft wireframe to represent better what we will need to do for our project.

## 5/9/2023
1. Unavailable to work on the project today.
2. Familiarize myself more with fastAPI, learn more about what needs to go into our API designs, and understand how we will meet our minimal value product.
3. My challenges for today and this week would be related to APIs and with more practice time for understanding how this will work and relate to our project.
