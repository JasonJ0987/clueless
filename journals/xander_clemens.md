## 5/8/2023
Developed ideas for our project and identified who our users are, the high-level functionality of our application, and the APIs needed to bring our project to life. Next, we constructed a logo and first draft wireframe to represent better what we will need to do for our project.

## 5/9/2023
1. Unavailable to work on the project today.
2. Familiarize myself more with fastAPI, learn more about what needs to go into our API designs, and understand how we will meet our minimal value product.
3. My challenges for today and this week would be related to APIs and with more practice time for understanding how this will work and relate to our project.

## 5/10/2023
1. We finalized our wireframes, met with our project consultant to understand the importance of our Most Viable Product, created our first version of our out API endpoints, and uploaded everything into our project code.
2. Organize our wireframe images and assist in the creation of our FastAPI endpoints to use in our design.
3. Mainting a realist perspective on our work of our wireframe, following our key bullet points addressed to our Minimal Viable Product list, and knowing that the following weeks of learning new technologies and integrating our API needs to be heavily focused on still achieving our Minimal Viable Product list.
