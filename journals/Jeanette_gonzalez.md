1. What did you do? 
For the project "I wear whatevr", I helped devolop with my team ideas for the application for planning outfits to wear based on the ecvents. The planned outfits would go based off of how the weather is on that poertaining day. 

2. What are you planning to do today?
Today I am planning on discussing more ideas with my teammates and coming to an agreement on which API we believe would be the correct choice for our application.

2. Do you have any blockers/challenges to your progress?
I currently do not have any blockers/challenges since today we are sorting out all of our ideas for the application.
