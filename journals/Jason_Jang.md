1. Yesterday, we started our WireFrame production. We generated an idea and gave an elevator pitch to our instructors. They gave us recommendations on our project, mostly to skim down on our functions
    and get our VMP out. Form over function is the mindset we need.

2. Today we will aim to finish up our WireFrame and discuss whether we want separate microservices or a single monolithic app. Will begin to structure our API design and endpoints.

3. No current blockers
