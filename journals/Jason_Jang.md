1. Yesterday, we started our WireFrame production. We generated an idea and gave an elevator pitch to our instructors. They gave us recommendations on our project, mostly to skim down on our functions and get our VMP out. Form over function is the mindset we need.

2. Today we will aim to finish up our WireFrame and discuss whether we want separate microservices or a single monolithic app. Will begin to structure our API design and endpoints.

3. No current blockers

1. Yesterday, we wrapped up our WireFrame. Started on the API design.

2. Today we will present our WireFrame to the instructor to get the okay to export the Wireframe to our project, once we get the okay, we will move the wireframe into our docs folder. Then we will aim to complete our API designs.

3. Concept of API Design is challenging, will need time and clarification.

## 05/11/2023
1. Yesterday, we got clarification on how API designs are generated. As a team we tackled how we want our API designs to look like, ideally. We were made aware that our end product and API design may not necessarily line up together and that is fine.

2. Today, as a group we plan on taking another look at our API design to make sure we like what we created. Then we will look into making issues.

3. Blockers for today is that we don't know how to make issues yet.

## 05/12/2023
